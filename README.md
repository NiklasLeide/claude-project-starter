# Niklas's Project Starter Kit v2

One script. Under 2 minutes. Ready to code.

## What it does

1. Asks ~8 questions — name, description, stack, GitHub prefs
2. Creates the full folder + doc structure
3. Writes lean, pre-filled `.md` files (CLAUDE.md, DECISIONS.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md)
4. Installs 6 custom Claude Code slash commands
5. Runs `git init` + initial commit
6. Creates GitHub repo, cleans up default labels, adds custom labels, creates milestone, creates Project board

## Requirements

```bash
# Python 3.7+ (you have this)
pip install requests         # for GitHub API calls

# GitHub auth — one of:
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...  # personal access token
# OR:
gh auth login                # if you have gh CLI installed
```

**GitHub token needs:** `repo`, `project` scopes.  
Create at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

## Usage

```bash
python new_project.py
```

That's it. Answer the questions, confirm, done.

```

The plugin (`project@niklas-marketplace`) provides:
- `shared-conventions.md` — commit rule, DoD, sprint closure, communication, brief format
- Slash commands — /project:brief, :status, :decide, :review, :log, :scope, :init, :resume, :parkhere
- Sub-agents — dod-reviewer (sprint close verification), code-researcher (tactical API research)
- SessionStart hook — DoD reminder at every session start
- Universal MCPs — Context7 (up-to-date library docs via `npx`), GitHub (remote HTTP, auth via `${GITHUB_TOKEN}`)

Tauri projects also get `rust-analyzer-lsp@claude-plugins-official` (from `superpowers-marketplace`) declared in their generated `.claude/settings.json` — non-Tauri projects do not.

## GitHub labels created

| Label | Color | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `feature` | green | New functionality |
| `bug` | red | Something broken |
| `decision` | blue | Architectural choice needed |
| `tech-debt` | yellow | Refactor needed |
| `blocked` | dark red | Cannot proceed |
| `question` | pink | Needs clarification |
| `wontfix` | grey | Not going to fix |
| `scope-creep` | light pink | Out of current scope |

## Slash commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/project:brief` | Token-efficient session start. Reads status + last decisions, asks what you're building today |
| `/project:status` | Read-only overview of phase, in-progress, blockers, next |
| `/project:decide` | Claude challenges your decision BEFORE logging the ADR — plays devil's advocate |
| `/project:review` | Critical code review: simpler alternatives? tech debt? scope creep? |
| `/project:log` | Updates CHANGELOG.md + PROJECT_STATUS.md from recent git changes |
| `/project:scope` | Scopes a new feature, asks minimum viable version, drafts GitHub issue |

## Plugin dependency

Generated projects depend on the `project` plugin from the
`niklas-marketplace` private marketplace (GitHub: NiklasLeide/niklas-marketplace).

For Claude Code to fetch the plugin, you need GitHub authentication:
- `gh auth login` (recommended), or
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var with `repo` scope

The plugin is declared in each project's `.claude/settings.json`. Claude Code
syncs it automatically on startup.

## The philosophy baked in

**Non-sycophantic Claude:** CLAUDE.md explicitly instructs Claude to challenge decisions, flag scope creep, and skip flattery. `/project:decide` forces the conversation before the ADR is written.

**Token efficiency:**
- CLAUDE.md under 150 lines
- Docs referenced via `@path` — not inlined into context
- `/project:brief` loads only what's needed per session
- One-feature-per-session boundary enforced by Claude

**Decision trail:** DECISIONS.md logs what you chose AND what you rejected. The rejected alternatives are the valuable part.

**Plugin-based conventions:** Shared conventions, slash commands, sub-agents, and hooks live in a centralized plugin. Updating the plugin version propagates improvements to all projects — no manual file copying.

**Enforceable sprint closure:** Every sprint plan ends with a "Run DoD review" task. The `dod-reviewer` sub-agent verifies Definition of Done for the sprint scope — code works, tests pass, CHANGELOG updated. Sprints cannot be marked complete with open gaps.

**Layered enforcement:** `commit.sh` blocks commits without CHANGELOG updates. The GitHub Action blocks PRs with the same rule. The SessionStart hook reminds Claude of the DoD at every session. The sprint closure task catches anything that slipped through.

## First session

```bash
cd your-project
claude
/project:brief
# Claude reads status, then asks what you're building today
# Describe your first feature
# Claude will ask critical questions before writing code
```

## Make it a global command (WSL2)

```bash
# Put the script somewhere permanent
mkdir -p ~/tools/project-starter
cp new_project.py ~/tools/project-starter/

# Add alias to ~/.bashrc
echo 'alias newproject="python ~/tools/project-starter/new_project.py"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Now anywhere:
newproject
```

## Lessons applied from the lifecoach project

- Don't inline docs in CLAUDE.md — use `@path` references to preserve tokens
- CLAUDE.md over 150 lines = instruction quality degrades, Claude starts ignoring things
- ADRs without the alternatives column are nearly useless — the template forces this
- `/project:brief` at session start beats copy-pasting context every time
- `## What Claude Gets Wrong` section in CLAUDE.md is the highest-ROI section — fill it in after 2-3 sessions
- Changelog + status update at session *end* not beginning — otherwise it never happens
